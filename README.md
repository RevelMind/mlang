# M Programming Language Specification
M is a multi-paradigm programming language that can be both statically typed and dynamically typed.  It's main goal is to be as high level as possible, while still having little restrictions.

## Coding Example
A quick example of a simple M program could look like this:
```
function main(argc, args) {
    Log("Hello, world!");

    return 0;
}
```
It outputs `Hello, world!` to the console and returns an error code of `0`. (No error.)
